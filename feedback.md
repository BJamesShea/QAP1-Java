1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

Didn't take a massive amount of time, maybe 4 hours in total.

2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

I rewatched Java lectures, specifically the one that was 6 days ago (as of writing) when we went over these exact problems.

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

I ask Brad things every single day, but mostly for clarification on things.

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

Besides asking for an extra day, no. (sorry its a bit late!)

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one

6/10. Wasn't too hard. Java feels awkward and clunky, but that's to be expected.

I especially appreciated the way that the new format is done in regards to an assignment outline. Adding things like " deliverables " makes the process much smoother.
